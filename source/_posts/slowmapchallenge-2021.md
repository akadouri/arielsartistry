# Intro

Another year, another map challenge to squeeze creativity out of me. The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) started today to another round of great point maps. I don't quite have the time or energy to go through that again this year but luckily I stumbled across the [#SlowMapChallenge](https://danieljwood.github.io/SlowMapChallenge/) last week. To honor the spirit of slowing down, I'm starting this a week and a day late. Though I did "like" it around the time it was posted, that should count for something.

# Week 1/2

## Hammond's Atlas

Months ago I became obsessed with the simple style of the Hammond's Great Cities of the Word after buying a couple of those maps that had been cut out of the atlas and framed individually, a fate known by too many dusty atlases turned trendy art piece. Long story short, I found a copy of the original book and have thought about replicating the style since.

These maps are intended to give you an overview of a far away city of which you may know little about. They highlight the author's chosen landmarks with black boxes or square and leave the rest of the city an anonymous street grid. The book's copyright put its at 1958, a time before highways ripped through many of our American cities.

## Map Corporation of America's Map of New York City

Another map I bought recently (for $2 at a street fair, [though Argosy has it for $165](https://www.argosybooks.com/pages/books/287509/map-corporation-of-america/map-of-midtown-manhattan)) is an old map of NYC. The cover is in Spanish, though they didn't go through the trouble of translating the rest of the map.

## Plan

Over the next 10 weeks I'll try and work on a map inspired by these mid-century maps. One that features few colors, great fonts, minimal text, few points, and dotted land cover. A guide for a city with attractions, whatever those may be. I haven't picked a place to map yet, but it will probably be a neighborhood here in NYC. After that week's work session, I'll hopefully have some time to update the progress on this page.
