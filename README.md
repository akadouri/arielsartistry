# [ArielsArtistry.com](https://arielsartistry.com)

This repository contains the code for my personal website, including any tutorials or blog posts on the website. The individual posts are stored in [/source/_posts/](https://github.com/akadouri/arielsartistry/tree/master/source/_posts). There is a markdown file for each blog post, and then a folder with that post's assests (images, code snippets, etc). 

## To run locally

The website is made using static site generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html).

Dependencies: npm, git

```
npm install -g hexo-cli
```

then 

```
hexo generate
hexo server
```

The site will be running locally at http://localhost:4000/

## The theme

Thank you to [@klugjo](https://github.com/klugjo) for writing the tutorial [Create an Hexo Theme](http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/03/Create-an-Hexo-Theme-Part-1-Index/) which is a great overview of the compontents in hexo theme. This blog's theme started with that tutorial.
